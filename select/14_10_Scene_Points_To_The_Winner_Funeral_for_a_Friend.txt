Ink stained fingers promise everything and nothing
And therein lies the story
It's no easy sentiment, a conscious effort
Went to save the last
I love you just the way you are
So don't give up just yet
We all know it's hard, when it's so hard (when it's so hard)

Forgive me
Forgive me
Yeah!

It's easy to be, the quitter
So give up
Yeah!
