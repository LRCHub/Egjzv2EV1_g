I've seen trouble coming my way
She tried to push me to the ground
So I headed for the highway
And now I can't slow down
I don't need a preacher
Don't need a fool
To tell me what to do
I can't stop the feeling
Deep in my soul
Let all systems go

I'm the only winner
You're losing the game
I'm the only winner
You're fighting in vain
I'm the only winner
You're losing the game
I'm the only winner today

I'm a lover, not a teaser
I pull the trigger on you
I do anything to please ya
Shoot your heart in two
I don't need a preacher
Don't need a fool
'Cause I've made up my mind
I go by the numbers
Play by the rules
Gonna cross that line

I'm the only winner
You're losing the game
I'm the only winner
You're fighting in vain
I'm the only winner
You're losing the game
I'm the only winner

I'm the only winner
I'm the only winner
(You're fighting in vain)
I'm the only winner
I'm the only winner today
